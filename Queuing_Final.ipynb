        "Queue is a line or sequence of people or vehicles awaiting their turn to be attended to or to proceed.(Shortle, J. F., Thompson, J. M., Gross, D., & Harris, C. M., 2018)\n",
        "The simplest example of a queue is the typical line that we all participate in from time to time. We wait in a line for a movie, we wait in the check-out line at a grocery store, and we wait in the cafeteria line. Well-behaved lines, or queues, are very restrictive in that they have only one way in and only one way out. These queues must be managed and organized properly; this is where Queuing theory comes in.\n",

        "Queueing theory is the mathematical study of how line is form, how it functions (Shortle, et.al, 2018). Queuing theory scrutinizes the entire system of waiting in line, including elements like the customer arrival rate, number of servers, number of customers, capacity of the waiting area, average service completion time, and queuing discipline. The Queuing Theory is concerned with studying all the various dynamics of lines – or “queues” – and how they may be made to operate more efficiently.  In other words, Queuing theory is the study of queues and the random processes that characterize them. It deals with making mathematical sense of real-life scenarios.\n"

This process is more common where areas are more congested meaning places with large number of people. We basically must wait in line for everything and every day. We wait in line in our cars in jams or at checkout counters in our grocery stores, So queuing is a model of waiting in lines.\n",

        "Queueing theory was developed to predict the behavior of systems that provide service for randomly arising demands. This does not include unnatural demands. The earliest problems that were studied were of telephone traffic congestion. The investigator was a **Danish mathematician, A. K. Erlang**. He worked towards analyzing telephone traffic congestion with a goal of satisfying the randomly arising demand for the services of the Telephone exchange. Queuing theory was first introduced in the early 20th century.(Shortle, et.al, 2018)\n",
        "\n",
        "Erlang worked for the Copenhagen Telephone Exchange and wanted to analyze and optimize its operations. He sought to determine how many circuits were needed to provide an acceptable level of telephone service, for people not to be “on hold” (or in a telephone queue) for too long. He was also curious to find out how many telephone operators were needed to process a given volume of calls.\n",
        "The first paper on queuing theory, “The Theory of Probabilities and Telephone Conversations” was published in 1909 by A.K. Erlang, now considered the father of the field. His work with the Copenhagen Telephone Company is what prompted his initial foray into the field. He pondered the problem of determining how many telephone circuits were necessary to provide phone service that would prevent customers from waiting too long for an available circuit. In developing a solution to this problem, he began to realize that the problem of minimizing waiting time was applicable to many fields, and began developing the theory further.(Shortle, et.al, 2018)\n",

        "The main project that we are working on is the queueing system of Mc Donalds. If we have ever noticed how the drive thru system of Mc Donald's works, most locations have two lines leading up to the ordering booth. The lines later merge into one as they move through the payment window and serving window. Moreover, the server suggests some customers to park at a designated spot to keep the queue moving. So, we will be modelling the queueing system of Mc Donald's and figure out why most locations are constructed in that way.\n",
